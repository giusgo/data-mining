    <h4 class="font-bold text-xl">Outliers</h4>
    <p>Outliers are data points that significantly differ from other observations in the dataset. They can be unusually high or low compared to the rest of the data and can arise due to variability in the data or errors in measurement.</p>

    <h4 class="font-bold my-5">Outlier Detection Using Interquartile Range (IQR)</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li><span class="font-bold">Technique:</span> The IQR method was used to detect outliers. It involves calculating the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the data for each numeric feature. The interquartile range (IQR) is then calculated as the difference between Q3 and Q1. Outliers are identified as data points that fall below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.</li>
        <li><span class="font-bold">Reason:</span> The IQR method is a robust technique that is less sensitive to extreme values than methods based on mean and standard deviation. It is commonly used for datasets that may have non-normal distributions, which is often the case in medical data.</li>
        <li><span class="font-bold">Action:</span> Identified outliers were visualized using boxplots, and their counts were plotted to determine the extent of the issue. Outliers were removed to create a cleaner dataset for further analysis.</li>
    </ul>
